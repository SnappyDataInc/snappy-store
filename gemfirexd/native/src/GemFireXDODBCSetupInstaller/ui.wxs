sold.  Subject to the terms of this EULA and for \par
the applicable Term, Pivotal grants You a \par
non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without \par
rights to sublicense, to use the Software in the \par
country where You are invoiced in accordance with \par
the Documentation and the Pivotal license model as \par
set forth in the applicable Pivotal Product Guide, \par
for which You have paid the applicable license \par
fees. Software must be installed on equipment \par

Software, You may install that Software on \par
equipment located in any of the European Union \par
member states. You may allow third party \par
consultants or contractors to access and use the \par
Software on Your behalf solely for Your internal \par
business operations, provided, they are bound by \par

than this EULA and You ensure that such third \par
party use of the Software complies with the terms \par
of this EULA.  You may make one backup, unmodified \par
copy of the Software solely for archival purpose.  \par
If You upgrade or exchange the Software from a \par

Customer is responsible for complying with any \par
third party terms and conditions applicable to \par
such Open Source Software. These OSS license terms \par
may contain additional rights benefiting You. The \par

use only in accordance with the commercial terms \par
and restrictions of the Software's relevant \par
licensing model, which are stated in the Pivotal \par

access, permissions or rights which violate the \par
technical restrictions in the Software. \par
\par
3.5 Customer Responsibilities.  You are \par
responsible for separately obtaining any software, \par
hardware or other technology required to operate \par
the Software and complying with any corresponding \par
terms and conditions.  Customer is solely \par
responsible for all obligations to comply with \par
laws applicable to their use of the Software \par

hardware, and non-personally identifiable Software \par
usage statistics to facilitate the provisioning of \par
updates, support, invoicing or online services to \par
You.  You are responsible for obtaining any \par
consents required in order to enable Pivotal to \par
exercise the rights set forth in this Section 3.7 \par
and for Customer's use of the Software, in each \par
case in compliance with applicable law.  \par
\par
3.8 Audit Rights. During the term of this EULA and \par
for two (2) years after termination or expiration \par
of the EULA or Support Services and/or \par
Subscription Services for the Software has \par
expired, You agree to maintain accurate records as \par
to your installation and use of the Software \par
sufficient to provide evidence of compliance with \par
the terms of this EULA. Pivotal, or an independent \par
third party designated by Pivotal, may audit, upon \par
written notice to You, your books, records, and \par
computing devices to determine your compliance \par
with this EULA and your payment of the applicable \par
license and Support Services and/or Subscription \par
Services fees, if any, for the Software. Pivotal \par
may conduct no more than one (1) audit in any \par
twelve (12) month period.  In the event that any \par
such audit reveals an underpayment by You of more \par
than five percent (5%) of the license amounts due \par
to Pivotal in the period being audited, or that \par
You have breached any term of the EULA, then, in \par
addition to paying to Pivotal any underpayments \par
for Software licenses and Support Services and/or \par
Subscription Services fees and any other remedies \par
Pivotal may have, You will promptly pay to Pivotal \par
the audit costs incurred by Pivotal. \par

and no rights shall be implied from the provisions \par
hereof. \par
\par
5. SUPPORT SERVICES AND SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES.  \par
You have no rights to any updates, upgrades or \par
extensions or enhancements to the Software \par
developed by Pivotal unless you separately \par

conditions for such Support or Subscription \par
services as further described at \par
http://www.pivotal.io/support.   \par
\par
6. SOFTWARE RELEASES.  \par
Customer shall use and deploy Software Releases \par
strictly in accordance with terms of the original \par
license for the Software.\par
\par
7. TERMINATION.  Pivotal may terminate this EULA \par
immediately upon notice if You do not comply with \par
any term of this EULA.  In the event of expiration \par
or any termination of this Agreement, You must \par
remove and destroy all copies of the Software, \par
including all backup copies, from the server, \par
virtual machine, and all computers and terminals \par
on which the Software is installed or used.  Any \par
obligations to pay fees incurred prior to \par
termination and Sections 1, 2.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.8, 4, \par
7, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of this EULA shall survive \par
expiration or termination of this Agreement for \par
any reason.  \par
\par
8. IP INDEMNITY.  Subject to Section 9.3 herein, \par
Pivotal shall (i) at its own expense, defend \par
Customer against any third party claim that the \par
Software infringes a copyright enforceable in a \par
country that is a signatory to the Berne \par
Convention; and (ii) pay the resulting costs and \par
damages finally awarded against Customer by a \par
court of competent jurisdiction, or pay the \par
amounts stated in a written settlement negotiated \par
and approved by Pivotal. The foregoing obligations \par
are subject to the following: Customer (a) \par
notifies Pivotal promptly in writing of such \par
claim; (b) grants Pivotal sole control over the \par
defense and settlement thereof; (c) reasonably \par
cooperates in response to a Pivotal request for \par
assistance; and (d) has installed and used the \par
Software in accordance with the Documentation and \par
is not otherwise in material breach of this EULA. \par
Should any such Software become, or in Pivotal's \par
opinion be likely to become, the subject of such a \par
claim, Pivotal may, at its option and expense, (1) \par
procure for Customer the right to make continued \par
use thereof; (2) replace or modify such so that it \par
becomes non-infringing; or (3) request return of \par
the Software and, upon receipt thereof, refund the \par
price paid by Customer, less straight-line \par
depreciation based on a three (3) year useful life \par
for Software. Notwithstanding anything to the \par
contrary stated herein, Pivotal shall have no \par
liability to the extent that the alleged \par
infringement arises out of or relates to: (A) \par
combination, operation or use of the Software with \par
any other software, hardware, technology, data, or \par
other materials, if the infringement would not \par
have arisen but for such combination, operation or \par
use; (B) use for a purpose or in a manner for \par
which the Software was not designed; (C) any \par
modifications to the Software made by any person \par
other than Pivotal or its authorized \par
representatives; (D) any modifications to the \par
Software made by Pivotal pursuant to Customer's \par
specific instructions; or (E) use of any older \par
version of the Software when use of a newer \par
Software Release made available to Customer would \par
have avoided the infringement; or (F) any Open \par
Source Software not developed by Pivotal. THIS \par
SECTION STATES CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE \par
REMEDY AND PIVOTAL'S ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT \par
TO ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY \par
OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS BY ANY OR ALL OF THE \par
SOFTWARE OR ITS OPERATION OR USE.\par

misconduct, fraud or gross negligence, and where a \par

applicable mandatory law, Pivotal shall be liable \par
according to statutory law.\par
B. Subject always to subsection 9.3.A, the \par

"loss" shall include a partial loss, as well as a \par
complete or total loss.			\par
D. The parties expressly agree that should any \par
limitation or provision contained in this Section \par
9.3 be held to be invalid under any applicable \par
statute or rule of law, it shall to that extent be \par

liable for loss or damage which would otherwise \par
have been excluded such liability shall be subject \par
to the other limitations and provisions set out in \par
this Section 9.3.\par
E. The parties expressly agree that any order for \par
specific performance made in connection with this \par
EULA in respect of Pivotal shall be subject to the \par

failure, (i) make full and/or incremental backups \par
of data which allow recovery in an application \par
consistent form, and (ii) store such back-ups at \par
an off-site location sufficiently distant to avoid \par
being impacted by the event(s) (e.g. including but \par
not limited to flood, fire, power loss, denial of \par
access or air crash) and affect the availability \par
of data at the impacted site;\par
2) have adequate processes and procedures in place \par
to restore data back to a point in time and prior \par
to point of failure, and in the event of real or \par
perceived data loss, provide the skills/backup and \par

against power surges and unplanned power outages \par
with uninterruptible power supplies; and\par

system utility (e.g. but not limited to, volume \par
management, cluster management and backup) and \par
patch levels are kept to Pivotal recommended \par
versions and that any proposed changes thereto \par
shall be communicated to Pivotal in a timely \par
fashion.\par
13.3. Section 9.4 (Limitation Period).  The entire \par
section is deleted and replaced with: WAIVER OF \par
RIGHT TO BRING ACTIONS: Customer waives the right \par
